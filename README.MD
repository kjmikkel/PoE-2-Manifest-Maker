# PoE2 Manifest Maker
An application to make manifests for mods for the computer game Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire

Mods for Deadfire can have a manifest file that contains metadata information (such as version and for which version of Deadfire it will work for).

#Future plans
In the future the Manifest Maker may get more advanced thumbnail manipulation.

# Technical details
This application uses the [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)  pattern for the GUI part of the application.
